Code-Work
=========

A gathering of code for my portfolio use.

In this repo you'll find folders with whole projects in them (so i don't have to make a repo for each project.)  In each folder there will be a readme that will explain what exactly the project does and if there is any SQL or special application required to run it.  The sql dumps will be included and all sql strings will point to local host.

Thank you for looking at my repository and my code.
